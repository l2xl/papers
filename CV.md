## Summary

Experienced software architect and engineer with 20+ years in commercial development. Passionate about decentralized finance, cryptographic protocols, and real-time systems. Deep expertise in C++ and blockchain internals, from low-level protocols to smart contract scripting and cryptographic primitives. Strong contributor to open source and decentralized technologies.

I specialize in tackling non-trivial, exploratory, or research-heavy engineering tasks ‚Äî often under conditions of uncertainty or in areas lacking standard solutions or documentation. My recent work involved designing novel blockchain protocols (L15, UTXORD), developing scalable threshold cryptography, and building wallet infrastructure for protocols that didn't yet finalized at the time of development.

I seek roles where innovation, first-principles reasoning, and deep technical exploration are valued alongside engineering discipline and code quality.
